# Tree sitter for Unison

This is a WIP. Does not pass all tests. Need more tests.

### To do:
- [ ] bring terminology more in line with documentation or the `*Parser.hs` terms (`wordy_id` vs `identifier`, `symboly_id` vs `operator`, etc.)
- [ ] test escape sequences in Text literals
- [ ] do we need to support lcase, ucase, or both for hashes in base32hex?
