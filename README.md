# Tree sitter for Unison

* [2023-06-28] v1 released. All Unison entities parsed, but doc blocks are only parsed as a doc block without breaking them down further into sections, etc.

### To do:
- [ ] bring terminology more in line with documentation or the `*Parser.hs` terms (`wordy_id` vs `identifier`, `symboly_id` vs `operator`, etc.)
- [ ] do we need to support lcase, ucase, or both for hashes in base32hex?
