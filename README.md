# Tree sitter for Unison

This is a WIP. Does not pass all tests. Need more tests.

### To do:
- [x] use clause
- [ ] pattern matching ([see here](https://github.com/kylegoetz/tree-sitter-unison/tree/patterns))
- [x] where
- [ ] destructuring binds
- [ ] record types
- [ ] hash-qualifications for identifiers
- [ ] bring terminology more in line with documentation or the `*Parser.hs` terms (`wordy_id` vs `identifier`, `symboly_id` vs `operator`, etc.)
- [ ] lazy functionality (`'`, `!`)
- [ ] `alias`
- [ ] `namespace`
- [ ] `termLink`
- [ ] `typeLink`
- [ ] complex tests using production code
- [ ] test escape sequences in Text literals
- [ ] test watch expressions (`test>`)
- others?
